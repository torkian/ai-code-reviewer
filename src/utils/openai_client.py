    Perform an expert-level code review on the following diff. Focus specifically on these key areas:

    1. CODE QUALITY:
       - Identify non-idiomatic code patterns
       - Flag code complexity, duplications, or hard-to-maintain patterns
       - Suggest cleaner alternatives following language best practices

    2. BUGS & LOGIC ISSUES:
       - Identify potential runtime errors, edge cases, or logical flaws
       - Look for incorrect error handling or missing validation
       - Pay special attention to asynchronous operations, state management & error propagation

    3. SECURITY VULNERABILITIES:
       - Flag any security issues such as injection risks, unvalidated inputs, or insecure API usage
       - Look for insecure default configurations or leaked credentials
       - Identify potential authorization/authentication bypasses

    4. PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS:
       - Identify inefficient algorithms or data structures
       - Look for unnecessary loops, excessive memory usage, or resource leaks
       - Find redundant operations or computations that could be optimized

    5. DOCUMENTATION & READABILITY:
       - Recommend documentation for complex functions, classes or logic
       - Suggest meaningful variable/function names where they're unclear
       - Note where additional comments would improve understanding

    ```diff
    {diff}
    ```

    IMPORTANT: Format your response as JSON with the following fields:
    - overall_comment: A thorough summary of the changes covering their purpose, quality, and key concerns
    - file_comments: A list of objects with "file", "line_number", "category" (one of: "quality", "bug", "security", "performance", "documentation"), and "comment" for specific issues
    - documentation: A list of objects with "file", "line_number", and "doc_comment" for suggested documentation

    Example response format:
    ```json
    {{
      "overall_comment": "This PR adds error handling to the user service with generally good practices. There are two potential security issues with input validation and one performance optimization opportunity in the error processing function.",

      "file_comments": [
        {{
          "file": "user_service.py",
          "line_number": 42,
          "category": "security",
          "comment": "This input is used in a database query without validation, creating potential **SQL injection risk**. Consider using parameterized queries: \\n\\n```python\\n# Instead of:\\nuser_id = request.params.get('id')\\nquery = f\\\"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {{user_id}}\\\"\\n\\n# Use this:\\nuser_id = request.params.get('id')\\nquery = \\\"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = %s\\\"\\ncursor.execute(query, (user_id,))\\n```\\n\\nThis prevents attackers from injecting malicious SQL code through the parameter."
        }},

        {{
          "file": "error_handler.js",
          "line_number": 157,
          "category": "performance",
          "comment": "This operation iterates through the entire error list on each validation, resulting in O(nÂ²) complexity. Use a map/dictionary for O(1) lookups:\\n\\n```javascript\\n// Instead of:\\nconst error = errorList.find(e => e.code === errorCode);\\n\\n// Use this:\\nconst errorMap = errorList.reduce((map, error) => {{\\n  map[error.code] = error;\\n  return map;\\n}}, {{}});\\nconst error = errorMap[errorCode];\\n```\\n\\nThis is particularly important for large error lists or frequent lookups."

IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
1. Focus on identifying critical issues like security vulnerabilities, performance bottlenecks, logical bugs, and maintainability concerns.
2. Provide specific, actionable feedback that explains both the problem and the recommended solution with appropriate rationale.
3. ALWAYS use proper markdown formatting in your comments:
   - Format code snippets with language-specific code blocks like ```python, ```javascript, etc.
   - Use **bold** for emphasis on important points
   - Use bullet lists for multiple related points
4. For code quality issues, focus on logic, architecture, and best practices.
5. For documentation suggestions, ONLY focus on missing documentation for functions, classes, and complex code blocks.
